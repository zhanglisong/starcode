# Starcode Project Plan

## Goal
Build a new project named `starcode` with a clean initial architecture, clear milestones, and implementation workflow.

## Scope (Phase 1)
1. Repository scaffolding and developer tooling.
2. Core application skeleton and configuration system.
3. Testing baseline and CI setup.
4. Documentation for onboarding and operations.

## Milestones
1. Foundation
- Initialize project structure.
- Define runtime, package management, and environment strategy.
- Add linting/format/testing commands.

2. Core Build
- Implement core modules and boundaries.
- Add interface contracts for future integrations.
- Establish logging and error-handling conventions.

3. Quality & Delivery
- Add unit/integration test harness.
- Add CI checks (lint + tests).
- Add release/versioning workflow.

## Deliverables
- `README.md` with setup and usage.
- Source directory skeleton with clear module ownership.
- Test directory with sample tests.
- CI config and contribution guide.

## Risks
- Over-scoping too early can slow delivery.
- Missing architecture constraints can cause rework.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Confirm target tech stack.
2. Scaffold repository structure.
3. Implement first vertical slice with tests.
